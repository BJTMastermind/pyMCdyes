When you're calculating in this situation, the current color of the item acts just like an additional dye item in the crafting grid.\r\n\r\nTake this example:\r\n* Leather boots (greenish-brown): #72723F (Red: 114, Green: 114, Blue: 63) +\r\n* Rose Red dye: #CC4C4C (Red: 204, Green: 76, Blue: 76) +\r\n* Bone Meal dye: #FFFFFF (Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 255) +\r\n* Bone Meal dye: #FFFFFF (Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 255)\r\n\r\nwhich gives us this math (averaging 4 colors):\r\n* Red: (114 + 204 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 207\r\n* Green: (114 + 76 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 175\r\n* Blue: (63 + 76 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 162.25 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 162)\r\n\r\n... which results in our new [\"Clam shell\"](http://www.colblindor.com/color-name-hue/) color boots: #CFAFA2 (Red: 207, Green: 175, Blue: 162)\r\n\r\n### Dream of Available Colors\r\n\r\nIf every RGB combination were possible (values of 0 to 255 for R/G/B), there would be 16,777,216 possible dyed leather armor colors. \r\n\r\nHowever, when you average colors, you can't end up with an R/G/B lower (or greater) than the colors you put into it. While Bone Meal dye is able to provide us with the high value of 255 for R/G/B, the darkest dye we have available to us is Ink Sac dye (#191919 - Red: 25, Green: 25, Blue: 25).\r\n\r\nIt would appear we're now limited to 12,326,391 possible colors (using values of 25 to 255 for R/G/B) ... _if we stopped there_.\r\n\r\n### Theory of Available Colors\r\n\r\nIt might be more useful to think of applying a dye color to an item as slowly \"pulling\" the color of the item towards the dye color. Repeatedly applying the same color of dye over and over again will pull it closer and closer to the actual dye color until, finally, they end up the same.\r\n\r\nWhen you apply two different colors, you slowly pull the item towards a color that's equally distant from the two dyes. If you were to draw a line between those two colors in 3D [RGB colorspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space), you'd be pulling your item to a point that lies exactly 50% of the way between the two dyes.\r\n\r\n**Now expand that idea.**\r\n\r\nPlot out all 16 of the dye colors in RGB colorspace. Draw the 15 lines from each point to every other point. It'll look like a Hell's own cat's cradle, but you'll end up with a shape. It'll be a shape with 12 outer points (as the colors for Gray Dye, Light Gray Dye, Cocoa Beans dye, and Cactus Green dye will be contained deep within the shape).\r\n\r\nThis shape defines (mostly)* every single **TRULY POSSIBLE** color.\r\n\r\nThink of the shape as all the possible points you could pull a leather armor item's color towards. Applying a combination of dyes? Then you're only pulling it towards a point somewhere in-between the individual dyes (deeper within the shape). The 12 outer points represent the farthest you can pull an item's color in any individual direction. \r\n\r\nThe number of RGB points that are contained by this shape?\r\n\r\n**3,894,778**\r\n\r\nThat's a hell of a lot less than the \"12.3 million\" we estimated above.\r\n\r\nAnd sadly none of those colors are anywhere near the color of diamond armor (sorry guys).\r\n\r\n### Reality of Available Colors\r\n\r\n... You may have noticed I said \"(mostly)*\" above.\r\n\r\nThat's because of that \"rounded down to the nearest integer\" bit involved with figuring out the new average color.\r\n\r\nBecause of that little bit of math, that means it's possible to generate an average color that technically falls **outside** of the 12 pointed shape we made above.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nIf you take Ink Sac dye - #191919 (Red: 25, Green: 25, Blue: 25) and averaged it with Lapis Lazuli dye - #3366CC (Red:  51, Green: 102, Blue: 204), your average color of the 2 comes out as:\r\n* Red: (25 + 51) ÷ 2 = 38\r\n* Green: (25 + 102) ÷ 2 = 63.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 63)\r\n* Blue: (25 + 204) ÷ 2 = 114.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 114)\r\n\r\n... a dark [\"Venice Blue\"](http://www.colblindor.com/color-name-hue/) color of #263F72 (Red: 38, Green: 63, Blue: 114).\r\n\r\nThis color does NOT fall within our 12 pointed shape - because the \"true\" average contained in the shape is \"(Red: 38, Green: 63.5, Blue: 114.5)\". Those 0.5 point differences in Green and Blue are the difference between being inside and being outside our \"TRULY POSSIBLE\" color boundary.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, the FACTUALLY POSSIBLE colors leak a bit beyond that 12 pointed shape.\r\n\r\n... They leak enough that, so far, I've found the recipes for a total of 4,001,584 colors.\r\n\r\n... Yes, I have the recipes. All 4,001,584 of the ones I've found so far.\r\n\r\nIf you've got python installed on your computer, check out [my pyMCdyes tool](http://github.com/pudquick/pyMCdyes/) and give it a whirl. It's an interactive tool I've written to instantly show you a set of steps and dyes (not guaranteed to be the most efficient, just guaranteed to work) that you can use to get the color you want.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!
