          <h2>The First Definitive Study of Dyeing Leather Armor</h2>

<h3>Overview of Dyeing</h3>

<p>No, not dying - dyeing!</p>

<p>As most regular Minecraft players know by now, as of development build 12w34a, Minecraft include the ability to dye leather armor (<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Armor#Dyeing">http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Armor#Dyeing</a>) using the 16 different dyes that were already present in the game (<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wool_dyes#Data_values">http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wool_dyes#Data_values</a>).</p>

<p>The color your armor receives is calculated as an average of the RGB color values of the dyes you apply in the crafting grid.</p>

<p>For example, the following combination:
Leather boots (newly made) +
Cactus Green dye: #667F33 (Red: 102, Green: 127, Blue: 51) +
Cocoa Beans dye: #7F664C (Red: 127, Green: 102, Blue: 76)</p>

<p>results in greenish-brown boots with a specific color of: #72723F (Red: 114, Green: 114, Blue: 63)</p>

<p>because of this simple math (averaging two colors):
Red: (102 + 127) ÷ 2 = 114.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 114)
Green: (102 + 127) ÷ 2 = 114.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 114)
Blue: (51 + 76) ÷ 2 = 63.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 63)</p>

<p>Armor that has been dyed already can also be re-dyed - with its current color becoming part of the average, acting like a new dye item:</p>

<p>Leather boots (greenish-brown): #72723F (Red: 114, Green: 114, Blue: 63) +
Rose Red dye: #CC4C4C (Red: 204, Green: 76, Blue: 76) +
Bone Meal dye: #FFFFFF (Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 255) +
Bone Meal dye: #FFFFFF (Red: 255, Green: 255, Blue: 255)</p>

<p>which gives us this math (averaging 4 colors):
Red: (114 + 204 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 207
Green: (114 + 76 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 175
Blue: (63 + 76 + 255 + 255) ÷ 4 = 162.25 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 162)</p>

<p>which results in our new "Clam shell" (<a href="http://www.colblindor.com/color-name-hue/">http://www.colblindor.com/color-name-hue/</a>) color boots: #CFAFA2 (Red: 207, Green: 175, Blue: 162)</p>

<h3>Dream of Available Colors</h3>

<p>If every RGB combination were possible (values of 0 to 255 for R/G/B), there would be 16,777,216 possible dyed leather armor colors. </p>

<p>However, when you average colors, you can't end up with an R/G/B lower (or greater) than the colors you put into it. While Bone Meal dye is able to provide us with the high value of 255 for R/G/B, the darkest dye we have available to us is Ink Sac dye (#191919 - Red: 25, Green: 25, Blue: 25).</p>

<p>It would appear we're now limited to 12,326,391 possible colors (using values of 25 to 255 for R/G/B) ... if we stopped there.</p>

<h3>Reality of Available Colors</h3>

<p>It might be more useful to think of applying a dye color to an item as slowly "pulling" the color of the item towards the dye color. Repeatedly applying the same color of dye over and over again will pull it closer and closer to the actual dye color until, finally, they end up the same.</p>

<p>When you apply two different colors, you slowly pull the item towards a color that's equally distant from the two dyes. If you were to draw a line between those two colors in 3D "RGB colorspace" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space</a>), you'd be pulling your item to a point that lies exactly 50% of the way between the two dyes.</p>

<p>Now expand that idea.</p>

<p>Plot out all 16 of the dye colors in RGB colorspace. Draw the 15 lines from each point to every other point. It'll look like a Hell's own cat's cradle, but you'll end up with a shape. It'll be a shape with 12 outer points (as the colors for Gray Dye, Light Gray Dye, Cocoa Beans dye, and Cactus Green dye will be contained deep within the shape).</p>

<p>This shape defines (mostly) every single TRULY POSSIBLE color.</p>

<p>Think of the shape as all the possible points you could pull a leather armor item's color towards. Applying a combination of dyes? Then you're only pulling it towards a point somewhere in-between the individual dyes (deeper within the shape). The 12 outer points represent the farthest you can pull an item's color in any individual direction. </p>

<p>The number of RGB points that are contained by this shape?</p>

<p>3,894,778</p>

<p>That's a hell of a lot less than the "12.3 million" we estimated above.</p>

<p>And sadly none of those colors are anywhere near the color of diamond armor (sorry guys).</p>

<h3>Theory of Available Colors</h3>

<p>You may have noticed I said "(mostly)" above.</p>

<p>That's because of that silly "rounded down to the nearest integer" bit involved with figuring out the new average color.</p>

<p>Because of that little bit of math, that means it's possible to generate an average color that technically falls "outside" of the 12 pointed shape we made above.</p>

<p>See, if you take Ink Sac dye - #191919 (Red: 25, Green: 25, Blue: 25) and averaged it with Lapis Lazuli dye - #3366CC (Red:  51, Green: 102, Blue: 204), your average color  of the 2 comes out as:
Red: (25 + 51) ÷ 2 = 38
Green: (25 + 102) ÷ 2 = 63.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 63)
Blue: (25 + 204) ÷ 2 = 114.5 (rounded down to the nearest integer: 114)</p>

<p>a dark "Venice Blue" color of #263F72 (Red: 38, Green: 63, Blue: 114).</p>

<p>This color does NOT fall within our 12 pointed shape - because the "true" average contained in the shape is "(Red: 38, Green: 63.5, Blue: 114.5)". Those 0.5 point differences in Green and Blue are the difference between being inside and being outside our "TRULY POSSIBLE" color boundary.</p>

<p>As a result of this, the FACTUALLY POSSIBLE colors leak a bit beyond that 12 pointed shape.</p>

<p>... They leak enough that, so far, I've found the recipes for a total of 4,001,584 colors.</p>

<p>... Yes, I have the recipes. All 4,001,584 of the ones I've found so far.</p>

<p>If you've got python installed on your computer, check out <a href="http://github.com/pudquick/pyMCdyes/">http://github.com/pudquick/pyMCdyes/</a> and give it a whirl. I've written an interactive tool to instantly show you a set of steps and dyes (not guaranteed to be the most efficient, just guaranteed to work) that you can use to get the color you want.</p>

<p>Enjoy! </p>
