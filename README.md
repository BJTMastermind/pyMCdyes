# pyMCdyes 
<i>Explore 4 million+ leather dye recipes for Minecraft: Java Edition - Instantly!</i><hr>

**pyMCdyes** is an interactive python script for exploring just slightly more than 4 million pre-calculated dye color recipes for dyeing leather armor in Minecraft: Java Edition. For more information about why I believe this to be 99.99999%+ of the possible colors you can reach, please visit: https://bjtmastermind.github.io/pyMCdyes

## How to Use
Assuming you have python 3.9.x (haven't tested it with older 3.x versions), download the script and the associated .zip file and place them in the same directory.

Then simply type this to start exploring colors: <br>
Windows:
```cmd
python pymcdyes.py
```
Linux:
```
python3 pymcdyes.py
```

## For Developers
There are some basic functions in the script and you're more than welcome to use the dataset contained within the .zip file. Unfortunately the pyMCdyes script generates, at load, a portion of the information necessary to decode the dataset (base_mods and base_colors). I would distribute those as well, but it would easily (even compressed) triple the download size of this project.

(If you do decide to use all or a portion of my work elsewhere, I would appreciate a credit with my name.)
